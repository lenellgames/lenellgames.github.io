               <h3 class="major"><strong>Information We Collect</strong></h3>
               <p>We may collect through the Services both personal information that identifies you and can be used to contact you, and non-personal information, which is data in a form that does not allow direct association with you, which may include technical information, including the IP address through which you are accessing the Services and the unique mobile device ID or virtual unique device identifier for any mobile device you may be using.</p>

We will collect, use and disclose personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that some non-personal information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other information in a way that enables you to be identified, but the same information is considered non-personal information when taken alone or combined only with other non-personal information.</p>

                  <li><strong> Non-Personal Information </strong></li>

We also gather in-game events such as starting or finishing a level. This is done using Flurry, an analytics toolset. You can review the Flurry privacy policy here: http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html. If you want to opt out from Flurry, you can do so here: http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html</p>
               <p>We use this data to benchmark the usage of our games. This means that we regularly look at these statistics and try to find ways to improve our products. Note that we do not track your unique device identifier (UDID) or other personal information – this data is anonymous.</p>
